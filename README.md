# understat-analysis

Much like the fbref analysis, I have scraped data from the excellent website https://understat.com/, which contains more advanced metrics
xG, xA, xGBuildup, and xGChain from the 2014/15 season up to and including the 2029/21 season.

understat_scrape.py uses a python module to scrape all the understat data and export it in to a large csv file.

understat_chart.py produces a stacked bar chart of NPxG/90 and xA/90 for each player and the corresponding season for which the data is attributed. Plot is attached in this repository.
